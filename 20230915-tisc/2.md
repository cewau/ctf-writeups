# [2] XIPHEREHPIX's Reckless Mistake

Category: `crypto`

Description:

> Our sources told us that one of PALINDROME's lieutenants, XIPHEREHPIX, wrote a special computer program for certain members of PALINDROME. We have somehow managed to get a copy of the source code and the compiled binary. The intention of the program is unclear, but we think encrypted blob inside the program could contain a valuable secret.

---

Upon running the binary, we are prompted to provide a password:

For this challenge, the source is fortunately provided. Looking through the `main` function:

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char password[MAX_PASSWORD_SIZE + 1] = { 0 };
    int password_length;

    unsigned char key[32];

    printf("Hello PALINDROME member, please enter password:");

    password_length = input_password(password);
    if (password_length < 40) {
        printf("The password should be at least 40 characters as per PALINDROME's security policy.\n");
        exit(0);
    }

    if (!verify_password(password, password_length)) {
        initialise_key(key, password, password_length);
        show_welcome_msg(key);
    }
        
    else {
        printf("Failure! \n");
        exit(0);
    }
}
```

we see that the password needs to be 40 bytes long, and it is first ran through a verification function before it is even used for decryption. A quick look at that function

```c
int verify_password(char *password, int password_length) {
    unsigned char mdVal[EVP_MAX_MD_SIZE];
    unsigned int i;

    calculate_sha256(mdVal, password, password_length);

    uint64_t hash[] = { 0x962fe02a147163af,
                        0x8003eb5b7ff75652,
                        0x3220981f9f027e35,
                        0xfb933faadd7944b7};

    return memcmp(mdVal, hash, 32);
}
```

tells us that it is simply a `SHA-256` hash verification, which means that we are basically told to not guess the password especially given that the hash cannot be found in online databases (obviously).

A quick scan of the source also tell us that the decryption involves `AES-GCM`, which is pretty difficult to exploit. It is used in `show_welcome_msg`, which is just a simple GCM decryption using the key (which is in turn initialised by `password`). So if we don't exploit `AES-GCM`, and we cannot figure out the password to generate the key, what do we do?

The answer lies in the `initialise_key` function. If we can exploit the weakest link in an algorithm, we can usually quite easily compromise the final output.

```c
void initialise_key(unsigned char *key, char *password, int password_length) {
    const char *seed = "PALINDROME IS THE BEST!";
    int i, j;
    int counter = 0;

    uint256_t *key256  = (uint256_t *)key;

    key256->a0 = 0;
    key256->a1 = 0;
    key256->a2 = 0;
    key256->a3 = 0;

    uint256_t arr[20] = { 0 };

    calculate_sha256((unsigned char *) arr, (unsigned char *) seed, strlen(seed));

    for (i = 1; i < 20; i++) {
        calculate_sha256((unsigned char *)(arr+i), (unsigned char *) (arr+i-1), 32);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < password_length; i++) {
        int ch = password[i];
        for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
            counter = counter % 20;

            if (ch & 0x1) {
                accumulate_xor(key256, arr+counter);
            }

            ch = ch >> 1;
            counter++;
        }
    }
}
```

This seemingly long function can be broken down into 2 modular parts:

* `SHA-256` hash generation of the 20 elements in `arr`
* Derivation of `key` (`key256`) using `arr` and `password`

Notice that the first part is not dependent on any input, i.e. we can deterministically recreate `arr` without problem. The second part, while reliant on `password`, contains a serious vulnerability: We quickly realise that after running through the loop, the resultant `key256` is simply an `xor` combination of the 20 `arr` elements. This is because while an element can be selected multiple times, the additional copies simply cancel out with themselves through the `xor` operation. And recall that $2^{10} = 1024$, meaning that we can quite easily brute force a maximum of about 1 million decryptions to find a suitable key that will produce the correct password.

I originally wanted to create a simple Python script for the solve, but I switched to just patching over the initial C source instead, for 2 reasons:

* 1 million is still quite a lot of operations, especially for potentially time-intensive operations like cryptographic algorithms
* It is much more foolproof and implementation-independent by using the original decryption algorithm in its original language

Patches to the source are introduced in 3 areas. Firstly the main function which bruteforces all 1 million combinations that will produce actually significant differences in `key`:

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int idx;
    unsigned char key[32];
    for (idx = 0; idx < 1<<20; idx ++) {
        initialise_key(key, idx);
        show_welcome_msg(key);
    }
}
```

the second part of the key generation algorithm to skip the password overhead (on hindsight I could have sped up the operation by extracting out the first part such that it runs just once):

```c
void initialise_key(unsigned char *key, int idx) {
    // ...
    cur = idx;
    for (i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        if (cur & 0x1) {
            accumulate_xor(key256, arr+i);
        }
        cur = cur >> 1;
    }
}
```

and finally the plaintext check in `show_welcome_msg` to filter out the correct flag:

```c
void show_welcome_msg(unsigned char *key) {
    // ...
    // printf("Welcome PALINDROME member. Your secret message is %.*s\n", plaintext_length, plaintext);
    if (!strncmp(plaintext, "TISC", 4)) {
        printf("%s\n", plaintext);
    }
}
```

Finally, we compile the patched source and run it to derive our flag!

```bash
$ gcc patch.c -o patch -lcrypto -lssl; ./patch
TISC{K3ysP4ce_1s_t00_smol_d2g7d97agsd8yhr}
```
